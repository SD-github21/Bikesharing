# Bikesharing Analysis

## Overview of Bikesharing Analysis
The purpose of the Bikesharing analysis was to utilize a business intelligence software, Tableau, in order to develop data analysis visualizations that can provide potential investors with valuable insights about the viability of implementing a bike-sharing program in Des Moines, Iowa based upon data from a similar program in New York City. A "NYC Citibike Story" was created within Tableau to build a dynamic and informative business proposal.

## The NYC Citibike Analysis Story -- Results of the Bikesharing Analysis

### (1) The NYC Citibike Overview - August Data Dashboard
The below dashboard depicts an overview of basic information about the NYC Citibike program including the following key findings based on data from the month of August:

  - We start with a bird's-eye view of NYC with the "Top Starting Locations" map, which reveals the concentration of top locations where customers' bike journeys began in Manhattan
  - Next, our data shifts to the customer-level, where we can understand the population of customers participating in the Citibike program in more detail:
    -  An area plot showing customers' age by the average length of a bike ride tells us that younger riders tend to engage in longer bike trips.
    -  We can see that the total number of bike trips taken in August were 2,344,244
    -  Finally we can view a breakdown of gender within our population of customers:
      - Males represent the largest segment of the entire customer population (1,530,272  or 65.28%)
      - Females comprise approximately 25.10% of the customer population (588,431)   
      - 225,521 customers did not specific their gender and comprised 9.62% of the entire customer population

### (2) August Peak Hours
The next slide in our story shows the peak hours of bike usage in the month of August. This visualization reveals:
  - The start time of 5:00pm yields the largest number of bikes utilized, i.e., 224,566
  - The highest bike usage occurs within the time frame of 5:00pm-7:00pm  
  - The second highest bike usage occurs within the 8:00am-9:00am hour

### (3) Checkout Time for Users
The next slide in our story shows the length of time in minutes that bikes are checked out across all users in the customer population. The below graph suggests that the greatest usage occurs within the first hour time frame that a bike is checked out, with a peak occurring at the 5 minute mark and subsequently tapering down.

### (3) Checkout Time for Users
The next slide in our story shows the length of time in minutes that bikes are checked out by gender. The line charts for both females and males seem to mirror the above findings with respective peaks at the 5 minute mark and tapering down thereafter. However, bike usage for the group of customers whose gender is unknown appears to be steadier up to the 40 minute mark.
