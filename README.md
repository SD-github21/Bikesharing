# Bikesharing Analysis

## Overview of Bikesharing Analysis
The purpose of the Bikesharing analysis was to utilize a business intelligence software, Tableau, in order to develop data analysis visualizations that can provide potential investors with valuable insights about the viability of implementing a bike-sharing program in Des Moines, Iowa based upon data from a similar program in New York City. A "NYC Citibike Story" was created within Tableau to build a dynamic and informative business proposal.  

## Resources
- Data Sources: citibike_challenge.csv
- Software: Python 3.7.10, Anaconda 1.7.2, Jupyter Notebooks, Tableau Public 2021.3

The above dashboard depicts an overview of basic information about the NYC Citibike program including the following key findings based on data from the month of August:

  - We start with a bird's-eye view of NYC with the "Top Starting Locations" map, which reveals the concentration of top locations where customers' bike journeys began in Manhattan
  - Next, our data shifts to the customer-level, where we can understand the population of customers participating in the Citibike program in more detail:
    -  An area plot showing customers' age by the average length of a bike ride tells us that younger riders tend to engage in longer bike trips.
    -  We can see that the total number of bike trips taken in August were 2,344,244
    -  Finally we can view a breakdown of gender within our population of customers:
      - Males represent the largest segment of the entire customer population (1,530,272  or 65.28%)
      - Females comprise approximately 25.10% of the customer population (588,431)   
      - 225,521 customers did not specific their gender and comprised 9.62% of the entire customer population
